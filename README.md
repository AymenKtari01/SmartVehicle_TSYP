## Introduction

Step into the future of road safety with our innovative project aimed at creating a safer driving experience for all. Our endeavor revolves around two key components, meticulously designed to enhance Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and elevate the overall safety quotient of vehicles.



## Project Description

### Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS):
#### Driver Monitoring System (DMS):

The first part of our project features a robust Driver Monitoring System utilizing two computer vision models. The primary model keenly observes the driver's face, detecting signs of drowsiness, distraction, or inattentiveness by monitoring eye and mouth movements. This cutting-edge technology ensures that drivers stay alert and focused during their journeys.
Upper Body Activity Recognition:

Complementing the DMS, the second computer vision model concentrates on the upper body, detecting activities such as mobile phone usage, drinking, or engaging in distracting behaviors. Upon identifying potential risks, the system activates a sonorous alarm or delivers a voice message, prompting the driver to regain focus and avoid hazardous actions.
Intelligent Front Lights Upgrade:
Adaptive LED Lighting System:

As a transformative addition, the project introduces an upgraded front lighting system. By incorporating additional LEDs, precisely four on each side, the illumination becomes adaptive and responsive to the surrounding environment.
Radar-Assisted Light Adjustment:

A sophisticated radar system works in tandem with the LED lights. It assesses the presence of other vehicles in the vicinity, dynamically adjusting the intensity of the front lights. This intelligent adaptation ensures that the lights reduce their glare when another vehicle approaches, preventing discomfort or distraction for oncoming drivers during nighttime travel.

## Technologies Used

- **Ai model**:

   AI-driven prediction of driver behavior and drowsiness using advanced model.
- **Ai computer vision**:

   Real-time AI computer vision with Raspberry Pi camera for object detection.
